#   long url/Original url = https://google.com/absxys/kjeren
#   its short url form = http://localhost:5000/<short_code>
#   localhost = 127.0.0.1   => basically the default server
#   5000  => port on which flask runs  =>  127.0.0.1:5000 => the port/address on which the application will run.
#   <short_code> will be the code generated => has random letters + numbers => use Sqids for this
#   the short url is to then redirect the user to the original url

#   since we are running the mysql docker container on port 3307, make sure we have a mysql server created on port 3307 and the database name is url_shortener

Database configuration using environment variables for security:
#   This allows us to use our database credentials in a .env file instead of hardcoding them in our script.

For running separate mysql and flask application docker containers:
#   The host is set to 'mysql-container' which is the name of the docker MySQL container => make necessary changes in the .env and main.py files
#   There is no env variable for port
#   After building the image for flask application, first run the docker container for mysql and then run the docker container for the flask application.
#   Once, the containers are successfully up and runnning, go to http://localhost:5000 to see the application running.



For local development:
#   Set host to 'localhost' (or the appropriate host for your MySQL server) and port to 5000.
Add this to the .env file after MYSQL_HOST:
MYSQL_PORT=5000
Add this to the main.py file after defining host:
'port': os.getenv('MYSQL_PORT', '5000'),
#   Run the main.py file to start the application => view the running application in http://localhost:5000



For running mysql + flask together using Docker-compose:
#   My docker-compose.yml file has env variables set inside it, but you can also use the .env file
Make this change:
services:
  flask-app:
    env_file:
      - .env
#   Run the docker-compose commands and then view the application in http://127.0.0.1:5000


# it is necessary to create and run mysql as a docker container as containers can only communicate with other services via containers



RUNNING MYSQL:
# Preferrably => Create a separate server:
  Hostname = 127.0.0.1
  Port = 3307                          (this is because I already have a different server on port 3306)

Then enter the server details wherever necessary.
The server is not running by default. It runs when we run docker-compose.
